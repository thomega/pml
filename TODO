  * edit/rip: make flags -C and -P select sort_name

  * --edit_prefix/title: can we afford to loose '|' for alternation
    in the regexp when we use it as separator of regexp and
    substitution on the command line?

  * Edit.filename_safe collapses repeated whitespace.  Is this
    a good idea?

  * Artist_type: a 'composer' is more likely to be the composer than a
    'composer and conductor'
