  * edit/rip: make flags -C and -P select sort_name

  * Edit.filename_safe collapses repeated whitespace.
    This is not a good idea, because it spoils lexicographically
    sortable titles.  Instead collape repeated whitespace
    upon import and replace CR/LF by "; ".

  * Artist_type: a 'composer' is more likely to be the composer than a
    'composer and conductor'

  * choose composer and performer from the intersection of artists
    from the selected tracks only.
