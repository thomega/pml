Bugs/Urgent:

 * only prepend the overall title to the track title, if the overall title
   has been derived from a prefix

 * find a good replacement for question marks in file names to make Android happy.

Nice to have:

 * suggest to refresh the release JSON if it doesn't point back to the disc
   (this can happen while entering multiple discids)

 * make it easier to refresh JSONs
     - by discid/MBID
     - by --refresh_discid, --refresh_release, --refresh_artists flags
       (careful with --refresh_artists for multi-CD releases)

 * clean up the CLI

 * more testing with many more real CDs

Future enhancements:

 * make directory- and filenames configurable (templates)

 * make tagging configurable (templates)

 * change artists roles: select from disambiguation or add new ones

 * access artists' aliases

 * more tools for maintaing the cache
